Referencing standards in the source
===================================

When referencing standard documents use raw numbers xx.xxx for 3GPP
documents or xxx.xxx for ETSI document (eg: 23.040). If needing to
point to an specific section/subsection, explicitly say "Section foo"

3GPP specs can be found in http://3gpp.org/ftp/Specs.
