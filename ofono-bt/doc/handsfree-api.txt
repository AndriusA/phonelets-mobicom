					 [service].Error.InvalidArguments
					 [service].Error.Failed

		boolean InbandRinging [readonly]

			Boolean representing whether inband ringing is enabled.

			Non-persistent Boolean property representing whether
			echo canceling and noise reduction is enabled in the
			AG. This feature can only be disabled once from the
			HF unit; the current specification does not allow the
