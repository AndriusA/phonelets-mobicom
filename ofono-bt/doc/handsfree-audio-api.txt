Service		org.ofono
Interface	org.ofono.HandsfreeAudioManager
Object path	/

Methods		array{object,dict} GetCards()

			Get an array of card objects and properties
			that represent the currently attached devices.

			This method call should only be used once when an
			application starts up. Further device additions
			and removal shall be monitored via CardAdded and
			CardRemoved signals.

		void Register(object path, array{byte})

			Registers a Handsfree Audio agent with a specific
			path (freely selectable by the audio subsystem) and
			list of supported codecs.  Available codec
			identifiers:

				1	CVSD
				2	mSBC

			through the Register method.

			Possible Errors: [service].Error.NotFound
					 [service].Error.InvalidArguments
					 [service].Error.NotAllowed

Signals		CardAdded(object path, dict properties)

			contains the object path of new card and its
			properties.

		CardRemoved(object path)

			Signal that is sent when a card has been removed.
			The object path is no longer accessible after this
			signal and only emitted for reference.
