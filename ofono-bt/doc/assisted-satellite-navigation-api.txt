Assisted Satellite Navigation hierarchy [experimental]
==========================================================

Service		org.ofono
Interface	org.ofono.AssistedSatelliteNavigation
Object path	[variable prefix]/{modem0,modem1,...}

Methods		void SendPositioningElement(string xml_element)

			Send an XML element conforming to the XML DTD for <pos>
			as defined in 3GPP 27.007 Table 8.55-2. This xml is
			used for transferring data associated with positioning
			requests received via control plane from the network.
			This includes assistance data requests and the results
			of positioning procedures. This method maps directly to
			the 3GPP 27.007 AT+CPOS command.

		void RegisterPositioningRequestAgent(object path)

			Registers an agent which will be called whenever a
			CPOSR AT response is received. The Agent must respond
			to requests using SendPositioningElement.

		void UnregisterPositioningRequestAgent(object path)

			Un-registers the agent.

PositioningRequestAgent hierarchy
==================================

Service		unique name
Interface	org.ofono.PositioningRequestAgent
Object path	freely definable

Methods		void Request(string xml_element)

			Receive an XML element conforming to the XML DTD for
			<pos> in 3GPP 27.007. This xml is used for transferring
			data associated with positioning requests received, via
			control plane, from the network. This includes
			measurement requests and assistance data. This method
			maps directly to the 3GPP defined +CPOSR unsolicited
			result code.

		void ResetAssistanceData()

			A request has been received from the network that all
			assistance data should be reset.  This is used for 3gpp
			performance tests.

		void Release()

			Agent is being released, possibly because of oFono
			terminating, AssistedSatelliteNavigation interface
			is being torn down or modem off.
			No UnregisterPositioningRequestAgent call is needed.
